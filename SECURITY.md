# Security Policy

This document describes the security policy that applies to all repos under
https://github.com/ianlewis.

## Supported Versions

Security updates for my repositiories will be applied the most recent major
version and its minor versions.

For example if 2.2.0 is the latest version:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| v2.2.x  | :white_check_mark: |
| v2.1.x  | :white_check_mark: |
| v2.0.x  | :white_check_mark: |
| < 2.0.0 | :x:                |

However, if the repository has not made a stable release (e.g. the latest
release is < v1.0.0) then only the most latest minor version will be patched.
