      [Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts](https://slsa.dev/) (SLSA) is
      a security framework, a checklist of standards and controls to prevent
      tampering, improve integrity, and secure packages and infrastructure.
      It’s how you get from “safe enough” to being as resilient as possible, at
      any link in the chain.

      I worked on tooling for GitHub that supports [SLSA v1.0 Build
      L3](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/levels#build-l3) at
      [slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator)
      and SLSA provenance verification at
      [slsa-framework/slsa-verifier](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier).

      [gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/) is an open-source Linux-compatible sandbox
      that runs anywhere existing container tooling does. It enables
      cloud-native container security and portability. gVisor leverages years of
      experience isolating production workloads at Google.

      I made major improvements to gVisor in the areas of Linux kernel
      compatibility, DOS prevention through resource management, crash
      reporting, OCI seccomp support, and Kubernetes integrations including the
      [minikube
      addon](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/tree/master/deploy/addons/gvisor),
      [containerd shim](https://github.com/google/gvisor/tree/master/shim),
      Docker, and [Knative](https://gvisor.dev/docs/tutorials/knative/).

      [Connpass](https://connpass.com/) is an IT events platform developed while
      at [BeProud](https://www.beproud.jp/). It made early use of social media
      connections as a way to recommend events, and provided unique features
      needed by the IT community.

      I began and led early development starting from scratch through [launch in
      Oct 2011](https://www.ianlewis.org/jp/connpass), and continuing until
      2014. I led technical development and design, proposing, designing,
      developing and launching numerous features including social network
      integration, multiple attendee types, access analytics, and community
      group management.

      [PyCon JP](https://pycon.jp/) is the largest event for the Python
      Community in Japan which boasts tens of thousands of members thanks in
      large part to it’s efforts. It is currently supported by the PyCon JP
      non-profit foundation which helps new developers through bootcamps,
      learning events, and sponsorships.

      I [co-founded](https://www.pycon.jp/history.html#pycon-apac-in-singapore)
      PyCon JP with Manabu Terada, Iqbal Abdullah, and Yasushi Masuda while at
      PyCon Singapore in 2010. After that I held various roles in the event,
      serving mostly as international liason, recruiting international speakers,
      but also contributing to the program committee. I was media lead for PyCon
      JP 2014 where I was responsible for the website, tickets & registration,
      CFP, and session calendar. I served on the board of the PyCon JP
      non-profit foundation as Vice Chair from it’s inception in 2013 until
      2019.
