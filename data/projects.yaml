      <a href="https://slsa.dev/">Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts</a>
      (SLSA) is a security framework, a checklist of standards and controls to
      prevent tampering, improve integrity, and secure packages and
      infrastructure. It’s how you get from “safe enough” to being as resilient
      as possible, at any link in the chain.

      I worked on tooling for GitHub that supports <a

      at <a

      and SLSA provenance verification at <a

      <a href="https://gvisor.dev/">gVisor</a> is an open-source
      Linux-compatible sandbox that runs anywhere existing container tooling
      does. It enables cloud-native container security and portability. gVisor
      leverages years of experience isolating production workloads at Google.

      I made major improvements to gVisor in the areas of Linux kernel
      compatibility, DOS prevention through resource management, crash
      reporting, OCI seccomp support, and Kubernetes integrations including the

      <a href="https://connpass.com/">Connpass</a> is an IT events platform
      developed while at <a href="https://www.beproud.jp/">BeProud</a>. It made
      early use of social media connections as a way to recommend events, and
      provided unique features needed by the IT community.

      I began and led early development starting from scratch through <a
      href="https://www.ianlewis.org/jp/connpass">launch in Oct 2011</a>, and
      continuing until 2014. I led technical development and design, proposing,
      designing, developing and launching numerous features including social
      network integration, multiple attendee types, access analytics, and
      community group management.

      <a href="https://pycon.jp/">PyCon JP</a> is the largest event for the
      Python Community in Japan which boasts tens of thousands of members thanks
      in large part to it’s efforts. It is currently supported by the PyCon JP
      non-profit foundation which helps new developers through bootcamps,
      learning events, and sponsorships.

      I <a href="https://www.pycon.jp/history.html#pycon-apac-in-singapore">co-founded</a>
      PyCon JP with Manabu Terada, Iqbal Abdullah, and Yasushi Masuda while at
      PyCon Singapore in 2010. After that I held various roles in the event,
      serving mostly as international liason, recruiting international speakers,
      but also contributing to the program committee. I was media lead for PyCon
      JP 2014 where I was responsible for the website, tickets & registration,
      CFP, and session calendar. I served on the board of the PyCon JP
      non-profit foundation as Vice Chair from it’s inception in 2013 until
      2019.
