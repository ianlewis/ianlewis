### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD041 -->

I'm an engineer in Tokyo Japan ðŸ—¼

I mostly code in [Go](https://go.dev/), [Python](https://www.python.org/),
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and Bash.

I previously worked for [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/), and
[BeProud](https://www.beproud.jp/).

ðŸ”­ My current interests are in Cloud Native Security and [Software Supply Chain
Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_supply_chain). I previously
worked on tooling for the [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/) supply chain security
framework. and the [gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/) container sandbox.

I'm particularly interested in dynamics between trusted/untrusted execution
contexts.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about sandboxing, software supply chain security, and Cloud Native
security.

âš¡ My current weekend projects are a set of tools to deal with
[todos](https://github.com/ianlewis/todos) in code, a [Go library for reading
Stardict dictionaries](https://github.com/ianlewis/go-stardict), and a [Go
library for lexigraphical parsing](https://github.com/ianlewis/lexparse).
