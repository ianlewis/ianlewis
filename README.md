# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work as a Developer Advocate for [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/) in Tokyo, Japan.

ðŸ˜„ My pronouns are he/him.

ðŸ”­ My current interests are in Cloud Native Security and [Software Supply Chain
Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_supply_chain). I work on
tooling for [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/) supply chain security framework.
Previously, I worked on sandboxing for Cloud Native workflows
[gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/).

I'm particularly interested in dynamics between trusted/untrusted execution
contexts.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about sandboxing, software supply chain security, and Cloud Native
security.

âš¡ My current weekend project is a set of tools to deal with
[todos](https://github.com/ianlewis/todos) in code.

ðŸ“« You reach me via email (the best DM): ianmlewis@gmail.com
